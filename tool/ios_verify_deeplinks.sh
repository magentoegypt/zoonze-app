# Proves that zoonze://app/... URLs actually navigate on iOS. macOS only —
# runs in CI (.github/workflows/verify-deeplinks-ios.yml).
#
# Why this exists: the app shipped without FlutterDeepLinkingEnabled, so iOS
# foregrounded the app on a deep link but never routed — a password-reset link
# landed the user on Home. Android was unaffected (its intent-filter drives
# Flutter's built-in handling). The plist key is the fix; this script is the
# evidence, because the bug is invisible from the Windows dev machine.
#
# Method: screenshot the app, fire a deep link, screenshot again, and require
# the two to differ. The iOS notification-permission alert is present in both
# frames, so it cancels out — any hash difference is the screen behind it
# changing, which is exactly what we're testing.
