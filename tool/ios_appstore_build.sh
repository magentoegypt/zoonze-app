# Build a SIGNED App Store IPA from the committed Apple Distribution cert (.p12)
# + the App Store provisioning profile, both under ios/signing/ — no fastlane
# `match`, no separate signing repo. macOS only.
#
# This mirrors tool/ios_sign_build.sh (the ad-hoc path). The only differences:
#   - export `method` is `app-store` (not `ad-hoc`);
#   - it selects the App Store profile — the .mobileprovision WITHOUT a
#     `ProvisionedDevices` list (that key marks ad-hoc/development profiles).
#
# Required:
#   - ios/signing/*.p12              Apple Distribution cert exported WITH its
#                                    private key, protected by a password
#   - ios/signing/*.mobileprovision  an App Store (STORE) profile for the app id
#   - env IOS_P12_PASSWORD           the password that protects the .p12
#
# Output: build/ios/ipa/*.ipa — ready for `fastlane beta` (upload_to_testflight).

# As in the ad-hoc path, we deliberately do NOT use `flutter build ipa`: its
# `xcodebuild archive` phase uses the project's CODE_SIGN_STYLE=Automatic, which
# can't provision on a CI runner with no Apple ID ("No development certificates
# available"). Instead: generate the Flutter build config, archive UNSIGNED, then
# export + sign with the manual App Store profile.

# would fail. Re-sign the app bundle with the profile's own Entitlements dict
# (which carries aps-environment=production) to restore it. Only the app bundle
# is re-signed; the export already signed the nested frameworks.
