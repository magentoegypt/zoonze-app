/// normal browse session evicts the top of the grid before the user has scrolled
/// back to it — the image then re-downloads and the screen looks slow again.
///
/// Product media is served `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable`
/// (verified against the CDN on 2026-08-21), and the URL carries a content hash,
/// so a long local TTL can never serve a stale image.
///
/// Note [Config.maxNrOfCacheObjects] caps the object *count*, not bytes: 600 ×
/// ~40KB ≈ 24MB in the typical case, but the store currently serves some 300KB+
/// PNGs. Revisit the count if/when the backend adds per-role image presets.
