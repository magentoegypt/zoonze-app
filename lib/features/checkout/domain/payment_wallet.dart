/// handed to the native `zoonze/payments` module, which SDK entry point runs.
///
/// Apple Pay and Samsung Pay are **N-Genius wallet flows, not new gateways**:
/// they authorize the same N-Genius order the card path uses, so
/// [PaymentProvider] gains no value and every exhaustive switch over it is
/// untouched. Only the Magento `method_code` differs.

/// Maps a Magento payment method code to its wallet.

/// Matching is loose *on purpose*. The backend method codes are provisional
/// (`ngenius_applepay` / `ngenius_samsungpay` per the contract, but not yet
/// deployed), and the cost of a miss is severe: a wallet code that isn't
/// recognised falls out of `PaymentMethodOption.isRedirect` and checkout would
/// show a success screen for an order nobody paid for. So the separators are
/// stripped first and the rest is a substring test, which absorbs
/// `ngenius_applepay`, `ngenius_apple_pay`, `apple-pay`, `applepay`,
/// `ngeniusApplePay` and the Samsung equivalents alike.
///
/// Note this normalisation is NOT reused by `tabbyProduct`, which matches
/// `cc_installments` with its underscores intact.
